    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
      OutKast was an American hip hop duo formed in 1992, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Point,_Georgia" target="_blank">East Point, Atlanta, Georgia</a>, composed of Atlanta-based rappers André "André 3000" Benjamin (formerly known as Dré) and Antwan "Big Boi" Patton. Achieving both critical acclaim and commercial success in the 1990s and early 2000s, the duo helped popularize Southern hip hop styles while developing distinctive personas and an idiosyncratic sound that incorporated genres such as funk, psychedelia, techno, and gospel.

      Benjamin and Patton formed the group as high school students in 1992. OutKast released their debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik in 1994, which gained popularity after the single "Player's Ball", reached number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart. With successive releases including ATLiens (1996) and Aquemini (1998), the duo further developed their sound, experimenting with a variety of styles and achieving commercial success. In 2000, Outkast released the critically acclaimed Stankonia, which included the singles "Ms. Jackson" and "B.O.B.". In 2003, the duo released the double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which featured the number one singles "Hey Ya!" and "The Way You Move" and would eventually win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Outkast next released the soundtrack for the 2006 musical film Idlewild, which they also starred in. In 2007, the duo went on hiatus and both members have since pursued solo careers. In 2014, Outkast reunited to celebrate their 20th anniversary by performing at more than 40 festivals worldwide in 2014, beginning at the Coachella Festival in April.

      The duo is one of the most successful hip-hop groups of all time, having received six Grammy Awards. Between six studio albums and a greatest hits release, Outkast has sold over 25 million records. Meanwhile, they have garnered widespread critical acclaim, with publications such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone" target="_blank">Rolling Stone</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_(website)" target="_blank">Pitchfork Media</a> listing albums such as Aquemini and Stankonia among the best of their era.
